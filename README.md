iPSR extends the popular Poisson Surface Reconstruction ([https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon](https://github.com/mkazhdan/PoissonRecon)). iPSR has no more need of oriented normals as input, but infers the normals in an iterative manner. It is used to reconstruct surface from only points input.

#### Our new work DWG improved iPSR. Please check it out [here](https://github.com/DWGTech/DWG).

### Compilation:
Windows: The code is tested by Visual Studio. The ipsr.vcxproj is an example to configure the project.  
Linux: The code is tested by GCC and Clang with makefile.  
Executable: [Win64](https://lcs.ios.ac.cn/~houf/pages/ipsr/iPSR.zip)

### Usage:
\-\-in &lt;input ply file name&gt;  
The input file should be in .ply format and only 3D point coordinates are needed.

\-\-out &lt;output ply file name&gt;  
The output file name. It should be in .ply format.

\[\-\-iters &lt;maximum number of iterations&gt;\]  
The maximum number of iterations. The default value of this parameter is 30.

\[\-\-pointWeight &lt;interpolation weight&gt;\]  
The pointWeight parameter of screened Poisson surface reconstruction. The default value for this parameter is 10.

\[\-\-depth &lt;reconstruction depth&gt;\]  
The depth parameter of screened Poisson surface reconstruction. It is the maximum possible depth of the octree. The default value of this parameter is 10.

\[\-\-neighbors &lt;number of neighbors&gt;\]  
The number of the closest sample points to search from every reconstructed triangle face. The suggested range is between 10 and 20. The default value of this parameter is 10.

#### Parameters:
The models in the data folder all could run with default parameters. Smaller depth helps with noisy points.
